Submission of the PyBank Challenge from Week 2 Python!
Here I was able to learn how utilise Python to analyse data.

During this challenge I was able to:
* Import and read a CSV file;
* Identify the data;
* Analyse the data: finding the maximum, minimum, average and the total number of data points in the data set.
